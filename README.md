##Too Many Mods


**What Is TMM?**

Too Many Mods adds the vanilla wiki in the game so you don't have to use the internet.
If you press F6 it opens a gui, in that gui you can choose what wiki you want.

**Mod Support**

It will supports some mods, it will be easier for me if there is an existing wiki from that mod.
if you craft your first thing from the mod you'll get a new wiki.
